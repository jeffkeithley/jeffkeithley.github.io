Bio
======
I am a PhD Student in Computer Science at the University of Iowa, advised by [Dr. Sriram Pemmaraju](https://cs.uiowa.edu/people/sriram-pemmaraju) and [Dr. Bijaya Adhikari](https://cs.uiowa.edu/people/bijaya-adhikari) in the Computational Epidemiology research group. I have performed research in highly multi-disciplinary settings over multiple project scales, from 3 collaborators to nearly 40. My primary research revolves around vaccine allocation approximation algorithms over network disease models, mainly **i)** the role of approximate submodularity in the guarantees associated with greedy allocation, and **ii)** the development of equitable vaccine allocation algorithms. This has provided me with experience using population and mobility data in the development of network disease models and vaccination algorithms. I have prior research experience studying the spread of cholera, data analysis for COVID-19, and mosquito-borne disease incidence under climate change. I am motivated to continue working with different disciplines to bring findings from various fields together to better solve problems in my own domain. I am also interested in learning more about how technical results make it into actual policy and using that knowledge to help develop better outbreak response strategies.
